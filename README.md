# Comparative-Analysis-of-Power-Factor-Correction-Techniques-Using-Simulation-Models
Analysis and implementation of Power Factor Correction (PFC) techniques using static capacitors, synchronous condensers, and VFDs. Focuses on improving efficiency, reducing losses, and enhancing stability in modern power systems.
This project focuses on analyzing and implementing different Power Factor Correction (PFC) techniques, including static capacitors, synchronous condensers, and Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs). Static capacitors are the most widely used solution due to their simplicity, low installation cost, and high reliability. They provide direct reactive power compensation at the load side, thus improving the overall system power factor. For applications that require dynamic reactive power management, synchronous condensers are employed. These are synchronous machines running without mechanical load and can either absorb or supply reactive power, enhancing both power factor and voltage stability. VFDs, though primarily designed for motor speed control, with modern active front-end converters, can achieve near-unity power factor but have limited use in large-scale grid-level correction.
